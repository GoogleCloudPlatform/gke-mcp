# Kubernetes Audit Logs Schema

The Kubernetes API server emits logs for each request that it processes, according to GKEâ€™s audit policy. 
These logs are useful to understand which user performed what operation through the Kubernetes API server.

See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/audit-logging for details about Kubernetes audit logs on GKE.

## Schema

Note that k8s audit logs are encoded into `LogEntry` objects. The audit information is encoded into a `protoPayload` field.

The following are the most relevant fields in a Kubernetes audit log entry:

-   `insertId`: An unique, auto-generated ID for the log entry.
-   `logName`: The name of the log entry. This value is always `projects/<project_id>/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access` (if the request is read-only) or `projects/<project_id>/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity` (if the request is write-only), where `<project_id>` is the ID of the project that owns the log entry.
-   `operation`: Information about an operation associated with the log entry, if applicable.
    -   `id`: The ID of the long-running operation that this log entry is associated with. This field has the value of `insertId`, because Kubernetes does not support long-running operations.
    -   `first`: Always set to `true`. Indicates whether this audit log entry is for the request that originated a long-running operation.
    -   `last`: Always set to `true`. Indicates whether this audit log entry is for the request that completed a long-running operation.
    -   `producer`: Always set to `k8s.io`.
-   `timestamp`: The timestamp of when the log entry was emitted.
-   `receiveTimestamp`: The timestamp that the log entry was received by the logging system.
-   `resource`: The monitored resource that the log entry is associated with.
    -   `type`: The type of the Monitored Resource. For Kubernetes audit logs, this is always `k8s_cluster`.
    -   `labels`:
        -   `cluster_name`: The name of the Kubernetes cluster.
        -   `project_id`: The ID of the GCP project where the GKE cluster is located.
        -   `location`: The location of the GKE cluster (region or zone).
-   `protoPayload`: The payload of the log entry, containing the audit information.
    -   `@type`: The type of the proto payload. Always set to `type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog`.
    -   `serviceName`: This value is always `k8s.io`.
    -   `methodName`: The name of the Kubernetes API method. Formatted as `io.k8s.<api_group>.<api_version>.<resource>.<verb>`. For example, `io.k8s.core.v1.configmaps.get`.
    -   `resourceName`: The name of the Kubernetes resource. Formatted as `<api_group>/<api_version>/namespaces/<namespace>/<resource-name>` for namespaced resources, or `<api_group>/<api_version>/<resource-name>` for cluster-scoped resources. For example, `core/v1/namespaces/foo/configmaps/my-configmap`.

## Sample Queries

### List data access audit logs

This query lists all data access audit logs for a given cluster, project, and location.

```lql
resource.type="k8s_cluster"
log_name="projects/<project_id>/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
resource.labels.cluster_name="<cluster_name>"
resource.labels.location="<location>"
resource.labels.project_id="<project_id>"
```
